The De Beers Group has entered into a mining service agreement at their Venetia Mine with Redpath Australia and Redpath Mining South Africa, following a rigorous selection process with internationally recognised underground contract mining companies. Venetia Mine near Alldays is the largest producer of diamonds in South Africa and is in the process of moving from open-pit to underground mining. “The next four years are critical for the Venetia Underground Project to achieve the key milestone of delivering its first ore production in 2022,” says De Beers in a press release. To achieve this, De Beers says, the project will need to increase its development profile to 1500 meters per month, as well as increase ore production to a total of six million metric tonnes per annum. “De Beers Group is therefore proud to partner with Redpath during this vital phase of the project, which will deliver long-term success for all stakeholders,” said De Beers. Redpath is renowned for its operational excellence and execution, and the awarding of the contract is an opportunity for the De Beers Group to lay the foundation for achieving its goal of self-performing all its future underground mining operations. As part of the contract, Redpath will provide skilled specialist personnel, training systems and operational processes to train, upskill and guide the De Beers Group workforce to achieve an international level of performance and capability in underground mechanised mining. “This will initially involve about 70 to 90 skilled specialist personnel from Redpath being brought in to bolster the performance of the mine in its operational execution. Over the course of the four-year contract, Redpath’s personnel will decrease as skills are transferred to the De Beers Group workforce,” says De Beers.
