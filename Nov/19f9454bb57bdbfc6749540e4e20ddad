Amidst Eskom’s energy crisis, many have welcomed the Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy’s approval for the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) to proceed and process licence applications for self-generation facilities of above 1MW. Among those who welcomed the decision was the agricultural sector, more specifically Agri SA. “The approval means that prospective applicants are no longer required to obtain ministerial approval for deviation from the IRP 2019 before applying to NERSA for a licence, and this bodes well for the agricultural sector as farmers will now be able to put up renewable energy sources above 1MW. The approval also makes provision for wheeling arrangements, and with the removal of regulatory and administrative constraints, an opportunity presents itself for Eskom to adjust its internal processes to accommodate the latest development,” said Agri SA in a statement this week. According to a statement from NERSA, the approval granted relates to generation facilities that fall into the following categories: * a generation facility that is connected to the national grid, in circumstances in which the generation facility supplies electricity to a single customer and there is no wheeling of that electricity through the national grid; and/or * a generation facility that is connected to the national grid, in circumstances in which the generation facility is operated solely to supply a single customer or related customers by transporting electricity through the national grid where wheeling arrangements are in place between all affected parties. “However, the approval by the Minister in the above generation facility categories exclude those that involve local government (provinces and municipalities) or supply to local government, as these will be addressed separately,” said NERSA. “Given the electricity constraints faced by the country, we are of the opinion that this is a positive stride towards alleviating pressure from Eskom as independent producers enter the market. A stable power supply is imperative for development and plays a critical part in economic growth, which is desperately needed by our country to tackle the social ills faced, and as Agri SA we believe agriculture still remains a key sector in achieving this goal,” said Agri SA. They added that they and their affiliated members remain committed in support for the timeous processing of licensing applications to ensure security of supply.
