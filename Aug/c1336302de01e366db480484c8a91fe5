The Soutpansberg suffered a great loss with the death of Mr Simeon Buys of Buysdorp. Simeon passed away on 28 July at the age of 81 years. “The Buys community of Buysdorp has lost a man of quality, compassion, and great leadership. He had by then already served, intermittently, many years in the Buys Management Committee (BMC). Aided by his wife, he was a horticulturist by which he could earn an income. I knew him to be up and about at 03:00,” said life-long friend Alexander Smail. Smail said he had served under Oom Simeon (as he was affectionately known) as vice-chairperson of the BMC from July 2002 until December 2009. “This was a trying time for the committee, with all the problems left behind by the outgoing committee. There were no funds to work with, land claims were coming in, division in the community, and many other problems. This was indeed a time when we needed strong leadership. We HAD SIMEON as our leader; what a leader! what leadership! He put us on a course of hard and difficult work, of which I bore the brunt! What a slave driver! The man was indefatigable,” said Smail. He added that Oom Simeon calmly led them. “…and one by one we overcame the problems afore mentioned.” The late Simeon Buys had a “boere matric” (Standard 6). “Se voet, I say! He was better than many matriculants of today in his capacity as a leader; a stickler for punctuality, correctness of financial records; in just about everything under his administration. He was driven by his love for the community and the Buys farms. One gets to know the real person when the chips are down. This revelation of the man earned my great respect and loyalty,” said Smail. Simeon was laid to rest on Saturday, 1 August, at the community cemetery in Buysdorp. “Thank you, Simeon, for the experience we acquired from your example. Rest in peace,” said Smail.
