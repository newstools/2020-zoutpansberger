"The build-up of rubbish all over Musina and along the Malaladrift road has prompted me and my friends to clean the areas where rubbish is dumped,” said Mr Ruan Wolvaardt, a resident of Musina. Wolvaardt and his friends started cleaning the Malaladrift road on 8 August this year. Most Musina residents, according to Wolvaardt, favour jogging or exercising along this road because of its beautiful scenery. The destruction of flora has, unfortunately, been going on for some time now along the road, and the municipality does not appear to be doing anything about it. “We can no longer enjoy our exercising because of the ever-increasing dumpsites on lay-bys along the road. This is our second week of cleaning the road," said Wolvaardt. At present, seven members are involved, but Wolvaardt hopes more people will join in the cleaning project. "Our aim is to extend this gesture throughout the whole of Musina town, cleaning all the streets and any illegal dumping sites,” said Wolvaardt. He added that the illegal dumping of rubbish was not the only growing concern in Musina. The crumbling road infrastructure and escalating crime are also a major concern. Responding to a media enquiry, Musina municipal spokesperson Mr Wilson Dzebu said that they and the community had a shared responsibility regarding rubbish. "As much as the municipality has an obligation to clean [rubbish] as part of the service delivery, community members also have a responsibility in keeping their areas clean. Despite the limited resources and manpower, the municipality is doing its best to keep the areas clean,” said Dzebu.
