The Madombidzha Rugby Club have partnered with Kone Village Boutique Lodge to collect blankets and clothes for less fortunate people in Madombidzha. Tony Marageni, spokesperson for the rugby club, said that with the winter cold coming, many of the residents of the area were in desperate need of warm clothing and blankets. He appealed to the community to donate blankets, clothing, and shoes to the drive. “We are also working with Grace IT who will make sure our collections will follow all the hygiene precautions to protect everyone from spreading the Covid-19 virus. All the donations will also be sanitized before being distributed to the community,” he said. Two collection dates have been scheduled to collect the blankets and clothing, namely on Wednesday, 3 June, and on Wednesday, 10 June. The collection will be done in Louis Trichardt, Tshikota, Sinthumule and Kutama. People willing to donate can contact Tony Marageni on 065 829 5655 or Rotea Sebata on 078 156 5467 to make arrangements for collection on the set dates.
