South African National Parks (SANParks) announced its decision to close all its tourism facilities in support of the nation-wide lockdown for 21 days to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. SANParks on Wednesday urged al overnight guests to vacate the parks immediately and return to their homes in time before the lockdown is enforced. However, guests from high-risk countries currently resident in the parks who arrived in the country before 9 March were instructed not to leave the parks. “All such guests have been identified and staff on the ground will provide them with support and further information regarding their travel arrangements as well as facilitate contact with their embassies,” said SANParks CEO Fundisile Mketeni in a press release. According to Mketeni, SANParks has reviewed its reservations policy to accommodate its valued guests and are happy to announce that all amendments and postponements will not be penalised or charged extra fees (T&Cs apply). “It is for this reason that we request guests whose trips have been cut short or those who cannot make their SANParks bookings due to the lockdown to rather consider postponement to a later stage instead of cancellations,” said Mketeni. In instances where the traveller may not have a fixed date for the postponed booking, Mketeni said, they should contact the call centre at reservations@sanparks.org.  Cancellations will, however, be subjected to the standard cancellation terms and conditions. SANParks said they would like to assure the public that essential services such as food delivery, fuel provision, security and emergency services as well as wildlife crime operations will continue during this time. “We would like to thank the public for their on-going support in line with government’s strategy to mitigate the impact of COVID 19, we all have an obligation to flatten the curve,” said Mketeni.
