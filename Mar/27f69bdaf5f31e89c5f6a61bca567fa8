As of the beginning of this year, Louis Trichardt High School became the first school in Limpopo to present Design as a subject for Grade 10 to 12 pupils. At present, the subject is only available in Grade 10, with 24 pupils enrolled for this year. “We are very excited about presenting the subject,” said Design teacher Mariza Joubert. She said it took them almost three years to get approval. What makes Design as subject great, said Joubert, is that it is extremely career and consumer orientated. “It not only appeals to the artistic child, but also the mathematics and science pupil with a creative mind,” said Joubert. She added that design, technology and science work well together to make top-quality products for export. The subject falls under the creative arts curriculum, which is split up into visual arts and design, each with its own subject matter. Design as subject offers four design fields, namely: * Visual communication, information, graphic design; * Environmental Design: Architecture, Interior design, Landscape design; * Industrial design - Product design (3D); and * Surface design (2D)-Textiles and pattern, fashion, jewellery. So, what qualities should a child possess if they are looking to take the subject? First off, Joubert said, the person must be an effective visual communicator. “They should be creative, innovative, and think outside the box. They must have original ideas and work well with others. They have to understand how design impacts our daily lives and improve our life standards,” said Joubert. She added that young people who understood what good design was were socially and environmentally responsible. For more information, phone Mariza at Tel 078 153 7037.
