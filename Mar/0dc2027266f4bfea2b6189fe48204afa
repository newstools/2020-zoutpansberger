The Makhado Municipality will suspend some of their services during the lockdown for 21 days. The Makhado Municipality’s spokesperson, Mr Louis Bobodi, said that the pay point for electricity in the villages would be open from 8:00 to 12:00, Monday to Friday. The library, vehicle renewal, which includes motor vehicle licence renewals, vehicle registrations and licence payments will, however, be closed. Traffic officers and call centres will be in operation, while workers who are working under waste management services will work for two days per week. He further said that some of the workers would be called if an emergency arose. Residents are advised that all events at the municipality have been cancelled. He encouraged account holders to make use of the municipality’s online service offerings, where possible, rather than visiting municipal customer centres for over-the-counter transactions.
