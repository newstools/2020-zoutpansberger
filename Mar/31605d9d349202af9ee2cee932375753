Still not sure which essential services will remain open at the Makhado Municipality during this 21-day lockdown period? Here is a list: Satellite pay points will be open from 08:00 to 11:00 on weekdays, while the call centre (087 350 2764) will continue to operate 24 hours daily. Did you know that you can also buy pre-paid municipal electricity at Mount Fuji Motors at 141 Krogh Street? For electrical faults, a standby electrical team will be on duty, while the water operator at the civic centre will be summoned as and when the need arises. The streets might be quiet but be warned, traffic-law enforcers will also be on duty. One of the biggest concerns for many is whether refuse removal will take place as usual. According to the municipality, refuse removal at shops, industries and commercial areas will be done twice per week, while refuse removal in residential areas will be done once every two weeks. Server-room inspection will be done once in five days, and for those who still might not know, the municipal swimming pool is closed, as is the municipal library. All social gatherings at the municipal hall have also been cancelled. “All municipal parks and violations of the regulations [regarding the lockdown] will be monitored by the municipal traffic officers,” the municipality warns. Funerals will also be conducted in terms of the regulations. Looking as post-lockdown, the municipality indicated that detergents will be applied in all municipal offices and halls before the lifting of the lockdown.
