When you have put in long hours of work each day, you are not just working for yourself. Unless you are breaking the law, you are also working to pay your share of taxes that help keep the country running. But what are you actually paying for? OpenUp, a civic tech organisation, has built the Tax Clock, which they update annually with the latest tax information from the Minister of Finance’s budget. It forms part of OpenUp’s mandate to build free tools that promote active citizenry by helping people make informed decisions for positive social change. Tax Clock is easy to use, and it calculates the time you spend contributing to government services, such as education, health or national debt - and the time that you are working for yourself. All you need to do is go to www.taxclock.co.za and fill in your salary. You will receive a minute-by-minute break down of how long you work each day for different parts of government costs, such as debt, education and defence. Adi Eyal, director of OpenUp, says the Tax Clock is an opportunity for people to engage with the budget through the money they earn - and the tax they pay. “When the budget comes out, people are usually only interested in how much they will be paying and if there are any rebates they can get. But they don't engage with what the budget is really about,” he said. “The budget is a statement of intent by government that says what our priorities are, and what we are going to spend your money on. So, it’s important for people to understand what they are working for. The Tax Clock will show them how they have contributed toward things like education or helped pay off national debt in a day.” This new version of Tax Clock incorporates up-to-date personal tax details from Finance Minister Tito Mboweni’s budget speech delivered in Parliament on February 26, 2020.
