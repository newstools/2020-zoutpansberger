Main Line Passenger Services (MLPS) announced last week that the railway lines had been repaired and that the Johannesburg-Musina-Johannesburg train service would start operating again from Friday, 03 January. According to a press release issued by the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) the reinstatement comes after MLPS issued a media release informing customers of the cancellation of the Musina train service as a result of heavy rains that caused severe damage to the railway lines in the Pienaarsriver/Tokomane area earlier last month. The long-distance train departs from Johannesburg to Musina via Polokwane every Friday at 19:00, and arrives in Musina on Saturday at 11:00. It departs again from Musina to Johannesburg every Sunday at 15:25 and arrives in Johannesburg on Monday morning at 06:30. For reservations, bookings and other customer enquiries, contact PRASA’s national call centre on 086 000 8888 between 07:30 and 16:00 or visit their nearest ticket office. “MLPS appreciates our customers’ patience and understanding and value their continued support,” said PRASA.
