For the Louis Trichardt SPCA another year has passed with moments of great sadness but also moments of great happiness. According to the local SPCA’s Alicia Thomas, they unfortunately saw a massive increase in the number of strays and surrenders during last year. On the positive side, however, many happy adoptions took place as well. The main reason for the SPCA’s existence is to prevent any form of cruelty against any animal. The Louis Trichardt SPCA has to do this in the vast Vhembe area. “We would not be able to do what we do if not for the amazing support from our community, businesses, our inspector Lawrence Khodobo, our committee, our kennel staff, our families, our volunteers and our vets. Thank you to each and every person who supported us this year in any way,” said Alicia. The Louis Trichardt SPCA can proudly say that they have one of the highest adoption rates, compared to other regions, in South Africa. This is due to their extensive networking support system across the country via social media and regular updates by their networking team. Their networking support system is so effective that they have even had adoptions from Wellington in the Cape. “What a great feat for a small-town SPCA way up north in the sticks,” said Alicia. Sadly, national statistics show that they are only making a small dent in the everyday challenges regarding animal welfare, but this makes the SPCA team even more committed to keep on doing what they are doing. On a local front, the Louis Trichardt SPCA’s statistics for 2019 are as follows:   Alicia urged the community once again to have their animals sterilized to reduce the number of unwanted litters. “Unless unregulated and unscrupulous breeding ends, our kennels will always be filled with animals who are in need of a home where they will be safe and loved.” For more information about the Louis Trichardt SPCA or to find out how you can support them, phone inspector Lawrence Khodobo at Tel 082 965 5151.
