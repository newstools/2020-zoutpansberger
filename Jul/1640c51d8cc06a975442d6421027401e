As the rate of Covid-19 infections continues to climb in the Vhembe District, the Makhado Municipality and Makhado Fire Station became the latest government buildings to close because staff members tested positive for the virus. Makhado municipal spokesperson Mr Louis Bobodi issued a statement on Saturday that the municipal offices will be closed from Monday, 27 July, until Monday 3 August. This will also affect the Dzanani and Waterval regional offices. “This is due to a Covid-19 case that has been reported. Offices will be opened again after all Covid-19 protocols have been completed and complied with,” said Bobodi. He added, however, that essential services such as waste removal, electricity and traffic would still be rendered. A day later, the Vhembe District Municipality issued a statement announcing the immediate closure of the Makhado Fire Station in Louis Trichardt after two of its employees tested positive for the coronavirus. The VDM, however, gave residents of Makhado the assurance that they will be assisted by neighbouring fire stations for fire and rescue. These neighbouring stations are Obed Mashaba fire station (015 534 3133), Vuwani fire station (015 961 6906) en Ramushwana fire station (015 962 0972 / 1211). Payment of VDM services can be made through the following account number at FNB: 6238 7689 668. “The Makhado fire station will be re-opened after all disinfection processes are complete,” said the VDM.
