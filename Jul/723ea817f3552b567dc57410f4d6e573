Limpopo police arrested two foreign nationals on Monday, 20 July, at the Beitbridge border post after the two apparently tried to smuggle illicit cigarettes worth just under R7 million into the country. According to provincial police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo the police were busy with their routine duties at the border post when they stopped a suspicious fuel tanker which was sealed at the top. Upon further investigation, police found 523 boxes containing thousands of cartons of illicit cigarettes hidden in a specially made compartment in the tanker. The street value of the cigarettes was estimated at R6 993 579. The suspects aged 36 and 44 are expected to appear in the Musina Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday, 22 July. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba commended the police members and all other role players for their alertness and dedication in finding these illicit cigarettes and arresting the suspects.
