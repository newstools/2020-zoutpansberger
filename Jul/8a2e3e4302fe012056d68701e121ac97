The Department of Agriculture, Land reform and Rural Development has confirmed a case of rabies in a stray dog in Louis Trichardt town. Rabies affects all species, including humans, and has no treatment with death as the only outcome. “We must thus act preventatively. We urge everyone to please vaccinate all your dogs and cats as soon as possible,” said the department. The department said that people who were exposed to saliva or a bite from an animal, should wash the wound with soap and water immediately. “Go to the nearest health-care facility without delay and report the possible rabies exposure,” said the department.
