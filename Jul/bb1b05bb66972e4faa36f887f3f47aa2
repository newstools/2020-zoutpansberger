Residents of Louis Trichardt continue to endure chronic water shortages. The newspaper, as well as social media platforms, have been inundated by calls from residents wanting to know when water supply will be restored to town. Some even stated that by Monday morning this week, they have been without water for five days already. A burst main water pipe feeding water to town from the water treatment plant at the Albasini Dam was earlier highlighted as the reason why water supply was interrupted to Louis Trichardt. It would, however, seem that the Vhembe District Municipality’s “quick fix” of the problem was not sufficient. Vhembe District Municipality spokesperson Mr Moses Shibambu confirmed this morning that the pipeline, which was temporarily fixed on Sunday due to a pipe burst, sprung another major leak and that officials are busy looking at other ways to repair the damage. Shibambu did not give any indication of how long repair work would take and by when water supply to town would be restored.
