Residents of the Makhado Municipality got a sneak peek into the 2020/21 budget for the region during Mayor Samuel Munyai’s annual budget speech that was delivered on air last Thursday. “Let me first acknowledge that we present the IDP and Budget Statement for 2020/2021 financial year under very challenging and unique circumstances. For the first time in 26 years of democracy, the nation and the world are experiencing unprecedented levels of pain and human suffering, disease, and death caused by the global outbreak of COVID-19,” Munyai said. Munyai tabled a R971,001 million operational revenue budget for 2020/21, with operational expenditure that will amount to R965,598 million. The operational expenditure includes the non-cash items, amounting to R120,089 million for depreciation and R41,135 million for assets and debt impairment. The final capital budget estimate for 2020/21 amounts to R247,179 million. To balance the books, Munyai announced a 6,22% increase in electricity tariffs and a 4,6% increase in property rates and all other services. As for salary and wages, an overall increment rate of 6,25% was agreed upon by the bargaining council, effective from 1 July this year. The total salary bill for the coming year will total R287,567 million and, according to the municipality’s calculations, this amounts to 29,78% of their total operating budget. Some of the major changes from the tabled budget include an increase on expenditure by R46 million for RAL- and Eskom-related projects that were initially capitalised instead of being budgeted for under the expenditure budget in the tabled budget. Contracted service has also been increased by R4 million to cover the budget for residential site planning and surveying in Dzanani township. Capital projects not completed from the municipality’s own funds amounting to R35 million have also been rolled over to the 2020/2021 budget year, and other income has been adjusted down by R36 million of agency fees, taking into consideration the accrual accounting. This has been recognised in the cash-flow statement. The total grants that are going to be received by the municipality for the 2020/21 financial years amount to R493,312 million. From National Treasury they will receive an Equitable Share of R385,034 million, while receiving R88,968 million from the Municipal Infrastructure Grant (MIG). The Financial Management Grant will be R1,7 million, while they will receive R2,270 million from the Expanded Public Works Program and R15,340 million from the Integrated National Electrification Programme (INEP). As for the capital budget, it will be divided between the following departments: technical services (R184,954 million), community services (R12,270 million), finance (R31,129 million), corporate services (R15,311 million) and regional offices (R3,515 million).
