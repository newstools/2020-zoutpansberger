Members of the South African Police Service at the Beit Bridge border post apprehended a 30-year-old suspect on Sunday for trying to smuggle explosives into the country by using a funeral undertaker’s vehicle. According to provincial police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo, the police were busy with their routine duties at the border post when a vehicle branded with the name of a funeral parlour from Johannesburg in Gauteng approached, towing a trailer. “The vehicle was searched together with its trailer and the police found 306 blasting cartridges and four rims of detonating cord, estimated at R700 800. The explosives were hidden in the trailer. The lone driver was immediately arrested,” said Mojapelo. Following the arrest of the suspect, provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba has once more commended the members for their continuous vigilance and dedication in arresting the smugglers. “The suspect, who is a foreign national, will appear in the Musina Magistrate’s Court soon on a charge of smuggling and possession of explosives,” said Mojapelo.
