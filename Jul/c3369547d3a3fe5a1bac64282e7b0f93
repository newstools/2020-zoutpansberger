The police in Haenertsburg are seeking information that can assist them in apprehending the suspects who attacked an elderly couple on a farm in the early hours of Sunday, 26 July, at about 02:45. “About three gun-wielding suspects allegedly broke into a farmhouse in the Houtboschdorp area and demanded money from the 73-year-old farmer and his 70-year-old wife. The wife was allegedly assaulted with the gun and suffered some injuries in the process,” said provincial police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo. Mojapelo said the suspects started ransacking the house while holding the couple at gunpoint. “They then stole an amount of cash, three firearms (two .22 revolvers and a .22 rifle) and the couple’s two cellphones. The suspects proceeded to the housemaid’s room, aged 48, tied her up and took cash and her cellphone. They then fled from the scene,” said Mojapelo. The police were called and immediately commenced with investigations. “Anyone with information that can lead to the arrest of the suspects is requested to contact Colonel Cecil Machimani on 082 451 7181 or the Crime stop number 0860010111,” urged Mojapelo.
