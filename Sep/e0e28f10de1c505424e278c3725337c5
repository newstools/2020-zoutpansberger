Although the “hype” surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic may have quieted down a bit, South Africans are warned not to let their [virus]guard down. On Monday, Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize reiterated the call for South Africans to continue adhering to safety measures against the coronavirus – despite the country’s recording fewer active cases. At that stage, South Africa remained in the top-10 list of countries with the most coronavirus cases after having recorded more than 638 000 infections and 14 000 Covid-19-related deaths. According to the ministry of health, nearly 564 000 people have recovered from the virus, with Mkhize saying that the current trend shows South Africa is in an encouraging situation. Mkhize’s call on South Africans to continue to adhere to safety measures, which include the now-mandatory wearing of a face mask in public areas, as well as the washing of hands and social distancing, comes amidst the relaxation of lockdown regulations to Level 2. With citizens now allowed greater movement, many people have started to experience a false sense of security that the Coronavirus threat has diminished. Government has warned, however, that this is not the case. “I think we mustn’t try and predict that there won’t be a second wave; we must act in a way to prevent the second wave. Because there is no clear scientific evidence as to what is happening, the main thing that we can rely upon is our own measures, where everyone assumes this virus is around, so put your mask on,” said Mkhize in a media interview with Morning Live. According to the latest statistics issued by the Department of Health in Limpopo on Wednesday afternoon (9 September), Limpopo has, to date, recorded 13 746 Covid-19 cases, of which 12 990 have recovered and 499 are still active. This has brought Limpopo’s recovery rate to 94%. Sadly, 257 Covid-19-related deaths have been recorded. The “worst-performing” district in Limpopo has been the Capricorn District with 4 524 cumulative cases, of which Polokwane contributed 3 860 cases. To date, 99 people have died from the virus.
