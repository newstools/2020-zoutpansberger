The Louis Trichardt SPCA held their fourth annual Mutt Mile on Saturday, combined with their monthly farmer’s market at their kennels along the Vondeling Road. “And what a great turnout we had. It was fantastic to see all the faithful Mutt Milers and familiar furry faces, but also some newcomers to the race!” said the local SPCA team. They thanked everyone who participated. “We hope you enjoyed the race and farmer’s market with us,” said the team.
This year winners were Brian Peli (1st in 5km run), Anika Badenhorst and Jackie (1st Mutt Mile), the Waller family and their family of six pooches (Best Dressed Award), Lente Schutte and Anika Steynberg with Epic and Elton (Top Adopted Dog Award) and Arrie Weyers and Vincent (Top Special Needs Award). “Congratulations to the Waller Clan and all their SPCA-adopted fur kids. Once again, you guys never disappoint. You all looked amazing!” said the SPCA. They also thanked their fabulous SPCA team for all the arrangements and hard work on the day. Special thanks went to one of their most loyal supporters, Letaba Wireless, for sponsoring the two fabulous first prizes and for sponsoring the water at the finish line too. A few more special thank yous went to Leach Printers, Supersigns, Madi Gras Water, Legacy Animal Clinic and Farmer’s Market Stalls. “We truly appreciate your continued support,” said the SPCA.
