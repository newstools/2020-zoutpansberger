Despite the festive nature of the December holidays, the season will unfortunately again deliver its fair share of drama and trauma, which will again bring about a shortage of blood. The South African National Blood Service (SANBS) has therefore embarked on a campaign to try and stock up as much blood as possible through several blood drives. One of these blood drives will be the Makhado Jail and Bail taking place at the SANBS’s blood donor centre at 27 Erasmus Street on 9 December. Donors can come and “bail out” their “jailed” friends by donating units of blood. The local “jailbirds” include Anthony Hees from Shammah Ministries, Hendré Labuschagne (Round Table Zoutpansberg 66), Riana Otto (Ladies Circle 4), Peshy Ngudza (Old Mutual), Lawrence Khodobo (SPCA Louis Trichardt), Shantel du Toit (Timbercity), sister Riana Viviers (SANBS), sister Sharon Botha (SANBS) and Hulisani Mathiba (Makhado FM). The public are invited to support this drive taking place from 09:00 to 18:00 on the day of the event.
