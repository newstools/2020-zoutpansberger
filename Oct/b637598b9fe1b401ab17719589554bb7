A swift response by the police led to the quick arrest of five cash-in-transit robbery suspects at the filling station near the Capricorn toll plaza on the N1 south on Tuesday morning. According to police spokesperson Col Brenda Muridili, an unknown number of suspects allegedly attacked and robbed security guards collecting money from the filling station and fled the scene. “The police were notified of the incident and a manhunt for the suspects commenced,” said Muridili. Shortly after the robbery, police spotted the suspects’ getaway vehicle at Tshilwavhusiku and subsequently arrested five suspects, aged between 33 and 38. “During the arrest, the police recovered one vehicle, five firearms and ammunition, as well as an undisclosed amount of money,” said Muridili. At the time of our going to press, the arrested suspects had yet to appear in the Louis Trichardt Magistrate’s Court on charges of armed robbery and the unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition. “We are appealing to anyone with information that can lead to the arrest of the remaining suspects to call Crime Stop number 08600 10111 or to send tip-offs on the MySAPS App,” said Muridili. In the meantime, national police commissioner General Khehla John Sithole has commended the Limpopo police on the arrest of the five suspects.
