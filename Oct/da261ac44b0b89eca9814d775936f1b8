Towards the end of each year, the University of Pretoria requests the name of Ridgeway College’s top student. This student is awarded a R10 000 bursary to study at that university. This year, Ridgeway College in Louis Trichardt is proud to announce that their headgirl, Ayesha Chhaya, is the recipient of this bursary. “Ayesha has consistently been our top achiever, proving that hard work and diligence pay off,” said executive head Ms Dionne Redfern. In what has been an incredibly disrupted year, many matriculants have struggled to remain motivated and focused. “This has not been the case with Ayesha,” said Redfern. “In a time of crisis, true character is revealed, and what we have seen in her is an unwavering commitment to her dreams. She has not faltered in her work and has, in fact, been all the more determined. With an aggregate of 93% in the Preliminary Examination, this bursary is so well deserved. We are hugely proud of her,” added Redfern. Ayesha is planning to study either medicine or engineering.
