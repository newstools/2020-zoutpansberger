The busy intersection at the Excel Garage at Malamulele resembled a war zone on Monday morning when police tried to stop a vehicle that they suspected was to be used to commit a crime. The cops were fighting the robbers for supremacy, but in the end the police emerged victorious and three suspects were arrested. The Thohoyandou police, in a joint operation with the Malamulele community and members of the Tzaneen Tracking Team units of the SAPS, believe they have successfully foiled what could have been a major heist. Limpopo police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the police managed to arrest three suspects. The suspects were found in possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition as well as equipment that can be used to break into premises. Brigadier Mojapelo said members of the Tzaneen Tracking Team acted on information received and followed a Nissan Hardbody bakkie. The three suspects were allegedly on their way to rob the Malamulele Quick Save Supermarket. According to Mojapelo, upon arrival at Malamulele, the tracking team identified the suspected vehicle and received further information that the suspects had already tied up a security guard. Back-up was summoned. “The vehicle was stopped along the Mavambe-Thohoyandou road at Makumeke village, near Dovheni, and upon searching it, items were confiscated such as one 7.65 mm pistol with seven live rounds of ammunition, one .38 special revolver and three live rounds of ammunition, grinding tools, crowbars and overalls. The arrested suspects are still to be linked to other similar cases within the district,” said Brigadier Mojapelo. Police investigations are continuing.
