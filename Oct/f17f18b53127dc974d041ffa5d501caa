The annual Vark van die Noorde bowls challenge was decided at the Louis Trichardt Bowls Club on Saturday, 17 October, between Louis Trichardt and the military bowls club from Air Force Base Makhado (AFB Makhado). The competition was decided over four rounds, and even though players were only allowed back on the greens after more than five months because of Covid-19, play was of a high standard. After the second round, the scores were tied and both clubs fought hard for victory. After the final round, the scores were still tied on 16 points each, but AFB Makhado eventually won the day on shot aggregate of plus seven and Louis Trichardt with a minus 18. This is the first time that AFB Makhado has won this competition since 2012.

It is an excellent sport for the whole family and to meet new friends. It is no longer old men's marbles but a sport for all ages,” said  flight-sergeant  Anton van Vuuren,  president of AFB Makhado’s bowls club.
