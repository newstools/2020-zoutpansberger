Makhado municipal spokesperson Mr Louis Bobodi has confirmed that the electricity supply to all parts of Louis Trichardt has been restored, following Sunday evening's initial power outages. The town was cast into darkness on Sunday evening as a result of a problem with the power lines feeding into the Stubbs Street substation. The areas affected included, among others, New Town, downtown Louis Trichardt and Forestry Avenue. Some were fortunate enough to have their power supply restored from 20:00 onwards. Others were not as lucky and were still without electricity this morning. “There was a cable fault which affected the substation that feeds into the affected areas and we managed to isolate that fault. As we speak right now, the lights are on as the problems have been addressed,” said Bobodi.
