Amidst ever-growing fears of a dramatic increase in COVID-19 cases over the next few weeks, the Zoutpansberg Private Hospital continues implementing measures to handle a possible crisis. On Wednesday, the hospital staff distributed a letter to all the neighbours, informing them of what is being planned at the hospital over the next few day. “As you have probably seen during the past week and will see in future days, we are busy preparing for a possible increase of patients arriving for screening and testing for COVID-19. However, there is no need to worry; every possible precaution has been taken to keep everybody safe during this time. Our in-patients, our personnel and our doctors are our priority, as we strive to support and care for our community,” the letter states. Among the steps taken is the erection of tents in the parking area adjacent to the hospital to act as additional triage and desensitisation areas. In the meantime, the hospital’s manager, Ms Anneke Stroebel thanked everyone in advance for supporting all the health professionals by staying home and washing their hands. “Remember: You are not stuck at home; you are safe at home. One word can change your attitude and one cough van change your life,” said Stroebel. She invited residents to phone them at 087 945 3271/2 if they should require more information.
