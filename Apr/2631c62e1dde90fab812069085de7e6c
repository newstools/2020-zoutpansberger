A so-called prophet from Shayandima was arrested on Saturday for allegedly distributing a video with false information about the Covid-19 pandemic. National police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo confirmed that the Thohoyandou police had arrested a man who called himself a prophet for breaching the regulations in place during the national lockdown. He said that the police had reacted to a tip-off from a member of the community, who was complaining about a video that was circulating. In the video the man allegedly denounced the call by Pres Cyril Ramaphosa to stay at home during the lockdown. He also provided false information relating to the pandemic. The Limpopo MEC for Health, Dr Phophi Ramathuba, welcomed the arrest of the suspect. She reiterated the call by the president to observe the rules and regulations during the lockdown. “As the Department of Health, we welcome the swift action taken by the South African Police Service in apprehending the alleged prophet immediately after we alerted them. This will serve as a deterrent to many people who think it’s business as usual to spread misleading information and fake news. The department will not tolerate anyone spreading fake news and insults directed at our President, especially during these trying times where we are all called upon to fight this Covid-19 pandemic,” said Ramathuba. Thulamela municipality’s mayor, Cllr Mushoni Tshifhango, said that they were disappointed with such conduct. He sent a stark warning to those who are disobeying the national lockdown regulations, saying the law would not hesitate to take action against them.
