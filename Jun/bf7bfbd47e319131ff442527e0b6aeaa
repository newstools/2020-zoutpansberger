Two Vhembe policemen and a civilian were arrested on Wednesday morning for allegedly robbing a police officer attached to the Local Criminal Record Centre of the SAPS in Kempton Park. A Warrant Officer stationed at the Mutale police station outside Thohoyandou, a Sergeant stationed at the Waterval police station outside Louis Trichardt and a community member from Khubvi village were arrested on Wednesday morning. “The Warrant Officer (from Kempton Park) was in the company of his wife, driving along the Tshandama to Khubvi public road when he was allegedly ordered by the occupants of a Ford Focus to stop, who in the process, allegedly pointed a firearm at them,” said provincial police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo. Mojapelo said the victim kept on driving until he was allegedly blocked by another vehicle, a Jeep Cherokee, in front of him. “He and his wife were then robbed of an amount of cash and a state tablet at gun point. The couple alerted the local police who immediately commenced with investigations which led to the arrests,” said Mojapelo. The acting provincial commissioner of the South African Police Service in Limpopo, Major General Jan Scheepers, praised the police for quickly arresting the suspects. He further condemned, in the strongest possible terms, the alleged criminal behaviour of these police members. “Although the majority of SAPS members carry out their tasks with diligence and integrity, decisive action will be taken against any member who engages in criminal activities,” said Scheepers. The suspects aged between 29 and 56 area due to appear in the Mutale magistrate today facing a charge of armed robbery. In the meantime, police investigations continue.
