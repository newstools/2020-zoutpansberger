Eric Louw High School in Musina was forced to suspend all classes last week, less than three weeks after allowing their Grade 12s back, after one of the school’s teachers tested positive for the dreaded Covid-19 virus. The initial report was that the school would remain closed temporarily until 6 July to allow for the premises to be deep cleaned. Over the weekend, however, the school issued a statement to all parents and guardians of children at the school that the school would re-open on 29 June after the school was deep cleaned over the weekend. Of the 80 Grade 12 learners, however, only 16 arrived back at Eric Louw this morning. Dr Sampie Phaswana, Soutpansberg-North Circuit Manager for Education, confirmed that the school had re-opened this morning. “In a small town like this, we understand parents’ fear, but we’ve already lost three months on the academic calendar. We cannot wait any longer,” said Phaswana. He assured parents and guardians that the department was doing everything in its power to get systems in place to ensure children’s safety. “I am confident the learners can return,” said Phaswana. In the meantime, the teacher who had tested positive was asked to self-isolate, as well as those she came in close contact with.
