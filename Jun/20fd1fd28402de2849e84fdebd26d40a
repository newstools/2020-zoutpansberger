Residents of the Soutpansberg learnt with great sadness of the passing away of Rodney Parkin (64) on Monday, 1 June. Born in Bulawayo, Rhodesia, on 10 November 1955, Rodney moved to Louis Trichardt in August 1983 to start up the family drilling business, Parkin Air Drills. In recent years, he was known in the local community for his tomato and cabbage farming. He leaves his wife, Janet, three children and their spouses, Brett and Katinka, Michael and Estie-Marie, Cheryl and Deon, and five grandchildren. The family would like to thank Vincent, Dolores and Vincent De Agrella, Toma Niemand and Johan and Mimi Rootman for their assistance and support last Monday evening. The family would also like to thank each and every person for their messages of support and condolences during this time.
